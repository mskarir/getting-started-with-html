    <h1>Stage 0 notes:</h1>

    <ul>

      <li><b> Mechanics of world wide web</b> - bunch of<br>
           computers - client computers/server<br>
          computers - hoocked together, transfering<br>
          information accross platform border lines -<br>
        using simply HTML language.</li>

      <p> <li><b>Structure of a web document</b><br>
       !DOCTYPE/head/body - all three<br>included in html tags.</li></p>

      <p><li> Yes! I may differ with my friend,<br>
        what was his name?, <b>Computers are not<br>
        stupid</b>. They are smart. You might have<br>
        given a simple calculator to Galaleo, Pascal<br>
        or Isac Newton, they could have appreciated<br>
        value of modern day computers. Computers have<br>
        their ways, they are stubboren at the most,<br>
        so are many people.</li></p>

      <p><li> Then we saw the cellur construction<br>
        of HTML languages - opening tag and closing<br>
        tag - nicely holding the 'contents' - my<br>
        god these tags came in various flavors - "a"<br>
        tag, "em" tag. Some tags wouldn't require a<br>
        closing tag, have already forgoten which ones,<br>any case we can look them up.<li><p>

        <p> Finally it was very well structured lesson<br>,somebody had put in some good<br>
          efforts to prepare it. It was uccessful.</p>
